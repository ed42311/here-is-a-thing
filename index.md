Notes for Applied Graph Algorithms

The [Cypher Refresher](https://neo4j.com/graphacademy/online-training/applied-graph-algorithms/part-1/) refers to a Yelp Sandbox. Didn't see that as an option:

This command ran:

with no problem in a Blank Sandbox, maybe the Yelp Sandbox has been discontinued in favor of the script?

Bit of a problem there, the script does not start with a database import. But I found this [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7f2Tdn94JhY&feature=youtu.be)

In [this section](https://neo4j.com/graphacademy/online-training/introduction-to-neo4j/part-7/#_importing_data) of the intro there is some talk about loading data over CSV from this resource `http://data.neo4j.com/intro-neo4j/movies_to_load.csv`

_Is there an endpoint for the yelp database as well?_

Broken link here:

guessing it might need to lead here: `https://www.yelp.com/dataset`
or here: `https://www.yelp.com/dataset/documentation/main`
or here: `https://www.yelp.co.uk/dataset/download`
